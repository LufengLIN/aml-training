# "Applied Machine Learning" training notes

**Note** This reposotory will always contain the most recnet version of these course notes. As the `tidymodels` infrastructure is being developed, we will update this repo to stay consistent with the current pac kage versions. 

This repo contains the slides, code, and data for the workshop in the `Materials` directory.

To get started, see the `installs.R` file in the `Preparations` directory.
